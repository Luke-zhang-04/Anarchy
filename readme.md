# Anarchy #

Game for my grade 11 cs project.

## Objective ##
It's 3030, and an experiment gone wrong has started an apocalypse. During this time, the world has gone into anarchy. War has broken out, and all hell broke loose. Much of the human population has died, but the United States, being a highly developed country, has survived. You are the president of the United States during this time. The existence of humanity hangs by a tread, and you have to keep your nation alive for as long as you can. Each month, you have to make decisions that will affect the future of the country. You must choose whether or not to adopt the proposal without letting either parameter drop below 0. You must satisfy four meters: The people, nature, military, and the economy. If any of these drops too low, you die, and the nation with you. Serve your 4 year (52 month) term, and keep America another chance. The fate of humanity is in your hands. Go on, president, and good luck.
