Much of the human population has died, but the United States, being a highly developed country, has survived. You are the president of the United States during this time. The existence of humanity hangs by a tread, and you have to keep your nation alive for as long as you can. Each week, you have to make decisions which will effect the future of the country. You must choose wether or not to adopt the proposal without letting either parameter drop below 0. You must satisfy four meters: The people, nature, military, and the economy. If any of these drops too low, you die, and the nation with you. The fate of humanity is in your hands. Instructions: Press f to toggle fullscreen, esc to terminate the program.
